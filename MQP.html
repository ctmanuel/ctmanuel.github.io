							<h2>Hikari Michi (光道): Light Road</h2>
							<p class="bld">ABOUT</p>
							<p>The main goal of this project was to create a unique and immersive virtual reality gaming experience for players using the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. The main idea for the game is a three-dimensional, first-person action game.  The core concept is that the player is''surfing'' along a path of solid light that is dynamically created in front of them.  Movement is automatic on the path and the player's speed is determined by a number of factors including vertical movement, speed-increasing pickups, and speed-reducing obstacles.  The player controls the direction and height of the path by using their hand in conjunction with the Leap Motion.  Using the head orientation tracking function of the Oculus Rift, the player can look around the world for objectives and obstacles.</p>
							<p>The goal of the game is to complete each level as quickly as possible. The player's best time on each level is recorded and visible on the main menu.  Each level is laid out like an obstacle course, with a variety of beneficial pickups and obstacles that can make the player lose speed or fail the level.  The path that the player creates persists in the world until the level is completed, so the player must be careful not to run into the additional obstacle presented by his/her path.</p>

							<p class="bld">MY ROLE</p>
							</object>

							<p>For this project, I acted as the project manager, level and gameplay designer, and gameplay programmer. I spent a lot of time programming the player behavior and the player's interaction with world objects. I was also responsible for implementing many of the game mechanics and their effects. As well as that I did a lot of backend programming, implementing resource management and managing the resource pipeline. Along with one of my team members, I worked with the Leap Motion controller API to read in the player's hand movement and have it translate to the game world's coordinates.</p>
